# Chat_py_git
This is my first python project used to chat between two users simultaneously .It uses Windows cmd and github for message transfer between computers 

### At present i had created the Gui part only and forgot to add the backend because of many reasons and now i forgot what the backend was going to be , so it is free to use the project as a template and yeah please mention me if you do so.(Adding a MIT license.)
